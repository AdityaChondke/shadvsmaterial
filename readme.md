### Material UI VS SHADCN/UI for creating UI Components libraray 



**1. Glitch Issue:**
   - Incorporating Tailwind CSS with Material-UI causes glitches during component loading due to the sequential application of styles.

**2. Fix in Material-UI Documentation:**
   - A solution exists in the Material-UI documentation, but it involves ignoring all Tailwind CSS configurations, raising questions about its necessity.

**3. File Size Concerns:**
   - Material-UI components tend to have larger file sizes compared to custom-built ones, impacting application performance.

**4. Dependency on External Updates:**
   - Material-UI's widespread use may result in updates affecting compatibility, whereas custom solutions, like shadow CSS, offer independence from external dependencies.

**5. Control and Independence:**
   - Custom-built components using shadow CSS allow for precise styling control, tailoring designs to project-specific needs.

**6. Performance Considerations:**
   - Developers should carefully assess the trade-offs between Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, and custom solutions based on the project's unique requirements and performance considerations.
